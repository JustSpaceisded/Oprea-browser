			<h3>Cityscape</h3>
			
		
			<p>Developed over many centuries, Kraków provides a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It is for this reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.</p>

			<p>Kraków's historic centre, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Old_Town" title="Kraków Old Town">the Old Town</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz" title="Kazimierz">Kazimierz</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Castle" title="Wawel Castle">Wawel Castle</a>, was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1978.The <em>Stare Miasto</em> is the most prominent example of an old town in the country.For many centuries Kraków was the royal capital of Poland, until Sigismund III Vasa relocated the court to Warsaw in 1596.</p>
		
			<p>Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World. Kraków historic centre is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times. The Old Town of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art. Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, stained glass, paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.</p>

			<p>In addition to the old town, the city's district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (<em>Pons Regalis</em>) across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine" title="Wieliczka Salt Mine">Wieliczka Salt Mine</a> and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.</p>
